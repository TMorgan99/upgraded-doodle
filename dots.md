## Here is help for the dotfiles

When setting up a new device and workstation, some apps need to have a base level of configuration.
I always forget!

So now, for the first time, I have configured the text that helps set this stuff up!

Just grab the code (the copy button), and paste in into your shell.
You should be good to go.

### [git]
```bash
git config --global user.name       "Tim Morgan"
git config --global user.email      "tmorgan99@gmail.com"
```

### [npm]
```bash
npm config set init-author-name = "Tim Morgan <tmorgan99@gmail.com>"
npm config set init-version = "0.0.1"
```

Thanks, Github, for this little feature, all code blocks have a copy button.

But how can I get the same behavior on my locally hosted markdowns ....
